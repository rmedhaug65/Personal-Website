		Currently working as an analyst/assistant portfolio manager at Stonebridge Capital in the Twin Cities. I grew up on a farm in north east South Dakota outside of a small town, Veblen (pop. 531). We raise corn and alfalfa which we sell to the local dairy for feed. After I graduated from secondary school, I moved to Albuquerque to play on the golf team at the University of New Mexico. I eventually decided that I did not wish to pursue golf as a profession and left the golf program to focus on learning about investing and technology. Following university, I got a job at Stonebridge Capital, where I am now, focussing on analyzing different sectors of the market and the companies within those sectors.

		I have always wanted to create my own website and after getting somewhat familiar with HTML, decided to try to hack something together. The purpose is to have an outlet to discuss ideas I am thinking about, books I am reading, and projects I am working on. Writing has the fascinating effect of making you distill your ideas down to the purest form with the consequence being it forces you to focus on first principles of the issue . My hope is that this website creates an incentive for me to increase my idea velocity, deepenen my thought, while focussing on first principles.
